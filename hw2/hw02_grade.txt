120/100

You're the only one who has done the Extra Credit problems so far.

I would say that the rise in temp is not unrealistic when the pulse is only a few nanoseconds long.  
The material would definitely vaporize though, before the entire 1 Joule pulse was absorbed.

Your solutions to the EC problems are very nice.  
Would you mind if I shared them as a part of my own solutions?
